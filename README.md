# Neon Whispers (I2P Hidden Service)

A lightweight, anonymous web chat hosted on the Invisible Internet Project (I2P).

## Features
*   **Privacy First**: Zero JavaScript. Zero external dependencies (No Google Fonts/CDNs).
*   **Pure C Backend**: A custom, multi-threaded C server (`server.c`) handling HTTP and Chat logic.
*   **Anonymous Chat**: Server-Side Rendered (SSR) public board.
*   **Secure**:
    *   Global Token Bucket Rate Limiting (20 RPS).
    *   Sandboxed via Alpine Docker container.
    *   Hardened against Buffer Overflows and Directory Traversal.
*   **Theme**: "Purple Pages" retro aesthetic.

## Architecture
*   **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS3 (No JS). Forms use standard POST requests.
*   **Backend**: C (Standard Libraries + pthreads).
*   **Network**: I2P (`i2pd`).

## Quick Start (Docker)

1.  **Build the Container**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t i2psite .
    ```

2.  **Run the Server**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name neon i2psite
    ```

3.  **Configure I2P**:
    Point your I2P tunnel (`tunnels.conf`) to `127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Manual Build (Linux)

```bash
gcc server.c -o server -lpthread
./server
```

## Protocol
*   **GET /**: Serves `index.html` with injected chat messages.
*   **POST /chat**: Accepts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (username/message), saves to memory, and redirects to `/`.
